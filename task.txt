Test Task
Unique words counter API

Create a web application to calculate the amount of the unique words in the
text.

The application must have two endpoints for interaction.
Application will require a database to store information with following
columns: id, creation_timestamp, text, unique_words_count.
Use datatypes you think are appropriate. Any database can be used (sqlite
is also OK), any library can be used to communicate with the database,
`sqlalchemy` is preferable, but not required.
Application should be implemented using `FastAPI` framework. Following
endpoints should be defined:
1. POST /words
Endpoint should accept valid json body with following structure:
{“text”: “text with any length”}
For provided text, the number of unique words should be calculated.
Consider space (“ ”) and endline (“\n”) as a word’s separators.
Consider that only following punctuation symbols are allowed: “,.:?!”
Information should be stored to database
id - generated by application
creation_timestamp - timestamp at the moment of handling request
text - text user provided
unique_words_count - number of unique words in text
Endpoint should return valid json response with structure:
{
“text”: “provided text”,
“uniqueWordsCount”: <integer-value>
}
E.g.: Incoming request with data
{“text”: “Live and learn? Learn and live!”}
Should be handled in way to return response with following json:
{
“text”: “Live and learn? Learn and live!”,
“uniqueWordsCount”: 3
}
2. GET /words
Endpoint should return list of previously processed requests with
following json structure:
[
{
“id”: <integer id>,
“createdAt”: <string datetime>
“text”: <string text>,
“uniqueWordsCount”: <integer number of unique words>
},
...(all other records)
]
Please, use git + github (or other resource) to share the code.
